# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
#
# 0. Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
#    this file as pseudocode.
# 1. You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# 2. You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# 3. For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
#    and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.
