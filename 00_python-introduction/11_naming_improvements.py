# SCENARIO: The code below works as expected and there are no errors.
# However, the variable names aren't great and don't follow the guidelines.
#
# code >>>  Name = "Ada"
#           lastName = "Lovelace"
#           FULLNAME = Name + " " + lastName
#
#           print(FULLNAME) >>>
#
# 0. Improve the variable names so they follow the PEP-8 guidelines.

name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
full_name = name + " " + last_name
