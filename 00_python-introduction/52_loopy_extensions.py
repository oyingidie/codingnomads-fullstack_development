# 0: Proof that the following file is a .pdf file using a `for` loop.
#           - filename = "operators.pdf"
#
# 1: Don't use the string method you've used to solve this before!
# 2: Don't use the `in` keyword to look for a sub-string!
# 3: Don't use any string slicing technique either!
#
# You'll see that it'll be tricky to solve this challenge with a loop :)
# Remember to use also other techniques you've learned,
# for example flags and conditional statements.
