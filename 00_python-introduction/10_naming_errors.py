# SCENARIO: When you run the code below, you'll get SyntaxErrors.
# The variable names are all messed up and don't follow the rules!
#
# code >>>  1stvariable = 40
#           second variable = 2
#
#           finally = 1stvariable + second variable
#           print(finally) >>>
#
# 0. Fix the variable names so the code works as expected.
