# 0. Demonstrate how to:
# 
#       - convert an int to a float
#       - convert a float to an int
#       - perform division using a float and an int
#       - use two variables to perform a multiplication
#
# 1. What information is lost during which conversions?
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# convert an int to a float
int_to_float = float(5)

# convert a float to an int
float_to_int = int(5.0)

# perform division using a float and an int
division = 5.0 / 2

# use two variables to perform a multiplication
a = 5
b = 2
multiplication = a * b
