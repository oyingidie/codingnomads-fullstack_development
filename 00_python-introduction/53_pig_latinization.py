# 0. Fetch the text of the CodingNomads collaborative story from:
#    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodingNomads/collaborative-story/master/story.txt
# 1. Save it to a variable in this script and remember to use triple-double quotes
#    for creating a multi-line string.
# 2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the story text
#    and string slicing to translate it to ~pig latin.
# 
# SCENARIO: For the purpose of this program, we will say that any word or name can be
# translated to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end, followed by "ay".
# 
# TIP: You'll need to use conditional statements to decide when a word is over.
#           e.g. You would never guess --> ouyay ouldway evernay uessgay

# fetch story (import or copy-paste)
# initialise variable for translation
# iterate over each word in the story
    # check if the word is valid
        # translate
        # otherwise add word as is
# print the translated story
